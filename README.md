## Swamp Smash

This is a game made in the Unity game engine. That means you will need Unity 4.3 or higher in order to compile this project.

This is a game made across a time of 6 days. Effective development time is considerably lower.
The code is of gamejam quality (that means it might be really quirky) but perhaps it can be of use for someone.

So I put it up here.


Have fun :)
