## Swamp Smash

This is a game made in the Unity game engine. That means you will need Unity 4.3 or higher in order to compile this project.

This is a game made across a time of 6 days. Effective development time is considerably lower.
The code is of gamejam quality (that means it might be really quirky) but perhaps it can be of use for someone.

So I put it up here.

## Notes
I have removed all material that might infringe any copyright or distribution agreement.
What you will have to get from the asset store is the AStar Pathfinding Project.
It's free and only used for the grounded mobs path finding.
You might aswell try to replace it with something home-brew.

You will also need to get a copy of protobuf-net from here: [https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net/releases]
or as a nu-get package if you're rolling that way :)
It's used to read and write highscores.

If there's anything else that breaks, let me know, I'll see what I can do.


Have fun :)
